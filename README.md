# Source code for ehgp.github.io

This Personal page is built with Python (Flask + Flask-FlatPages) and custom HTML + CSS. View live at <http://ehgp.github.io> forked from [Jack Brookes Flask Personal Website](https://github.com/jackbrookes/flask-personal-website)

* I had to freeze the website first using "python freezer.py".

* Had to paste contents of _build into the main branch for GitHub Pages to host.
