# TODO-AGENTS.md

## ✅ Completed Today
- [x] Removed the unintended left margin on hero social buttons at the mobile breakpoint by switching to a column layout and forcing 100% button width (`src/components/social-buttons.tsx`).

## Next Steps
- [ ] Re-run `npm run lighthouse` once Chrome can create its temp directory under `/mnt/c/Users/erick/AppData/Local` (current run fails with EACCES). Store the resulting screenshots + scorecards under `docs/screenshots/` per `docs/observability.md`.
