# Badge Asset Strategy

The home page displays 40+ shields generated by `img.shields.io`. Hosting local copies would require periodically regenerating PNG/SVG files and inflating repo size by ~3–4 MB per color variant. Given the frequency of badge updates and the desire to reflect live branding colors, we will continue using shields.io but keep a fallback plan:

- Remote hosts are whitelisted in `next.config.mjs.images.remotePatterns`.
- If badge providers ever throttle requests, download a curated subset into `public/badges/` and update `badgeSections` to prefer local URLs.
- Track this evaluation in TODO-AGENTS; revisit if latency or rate limits become an issue.
