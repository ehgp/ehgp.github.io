## Overview

REPLACE: Two or three sentences capturing the design intent. Name the
metaphor (e.g., "Architectural Minimalism meets Journalistic Gravitas"),
the audience, and the emotional register the product is trying to hit.

## Colors

REPLACE: Describe the palette philosophy. Why these neutrals? What does
each accent communicate? When to deploy the warning / error / success
trio. Reference tokens by name (`primary`, `tertiary`) so prose stays
synced with the YAML above.

## Typography

REPLACE: Pairing rationale (e.g., a humanist sans for body, a geometric
sans for labels). Hierarchy rules. Maximum line length. When italics are
permitted.

## Layout

REPLACE: Grid model (fluid vs. fixed-max-width), breakpoint set, gutter
and margin behavior. Whether the system uses an 8-pt rhythm or a custom
modular scale.

## Elevation & Depth

REPLACE: How depth is conveyed — shadows, tonal layers, borders, or
nothing at all (flat by intent). If shadows are used, describe spread,
blur, and color philosophy.

## Shapes

REPLACE: Corner-radius personality (sharp / soft / mixed). Whether
buttons and cards share the same radius or diverge. Any non-rectangular
shapes the brand reaches for (pills, capsules, organic blobs).

## Components

REPLACE: For each component above, write a paragraph on how it should
*feel* in use, what states it supports, and what it must never do.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do: REPLACE with a concrete invariant (e.g., "Always pair `display`
  with generous whitespace — at least 64px above and 32px below.").
- Do: REPLACE.
- Don't: REPLACE with a concrete failure mode you've seen agents commit
  (e.g., "Never substitute `tertiary` for `primary` in CTAs — it reads
  as a warning state in this palette.").
- Don't: REPLACE.
